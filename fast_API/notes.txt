FASTAPI
- API(Application programing Interface) is a set of endpoints for computer to computer communication.
ENDPOINTS E.g on a Todo Server
1. Create a Todo
2. Updating a Todo
3. Deleting a Todo
- FASTAPI is a modern python web framework for building efficient APIs.
Is optimized from high performance by using asynchronous server.

asynchronous Servers- Can handle multisessions at once and don't have to wait for 
one session to finish.(non-blocking tasks)
asynchronous- Allows a program to start a long-running task like a network request
and continue executing other code withoud waiting for it to finish.
Similar to multitasking. EG cooking dinner while doing laundry
async/await syntax.----> Normal programs use I/O bound(wait for function to finish)

DECIDE WHAT TO use
- Use Django if we want to have a comprehensive framework
- Flask if you want to have maximum simplicity.
- FASTAPI creating something that will have many users and requires performance.====> High performance.
Build: fast_api_hello_world.py
TO RUN:
    cmd>> fastapi dev fast_api_hello_world.py --port 444
NOTE: Some endpoints define methods that are CPU bound.
E.G 
#creating an endpoint
@api.get('/')
def index():
    return {"message":"Hello World"}

FASTAPI uses pydantic and enforces the types automatically

Without a frontend you can query a POST endpoint using Postman or curl
But FASTAPI api has a /docs endpoint to test our POST
-----> 127.0.0.1:4444/docs
The above is necessary for the post methods when testing a Todo

If an error occurs we raise HTTP exceptions!!
