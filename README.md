**Agents**: These are software systems that use AI to pursue a goal on behalf of the user.

**Multi-Agent**: Multiple artificial intelligence(AI) systems working collectively to pursue a goal on behalf of the user or another system.
Langgraph to build multi-agent systemsðŸ¥¶

**Langgraph** is one of the best frameworks to build AI Agents. It allows the large language models to control the application flow. It has features such as agent memory, RAG, and human-in-the-loop, which are very helpful in building Agents

# 1. Multi-AGent with two agents, i.e, DNSResover and PortScanner ðŸ¤–

One Agent is ineffective when using multiple tools. SOL: We use "Divide and Conquer" which involves creating specialized agents for each task and routing the task to the right expert in the graph.

# 2 Hierarchical Agent

Supervisor: is a multi-agent architecture where multiple agents are coordinated by a single supervisor agent. The Supervisor controls the communication flow, delegates tasks, and makes decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements
